### Activity Validation bot
<b>First of all add the bot to the chat and give it admin rights</b>

<b>You need to use this command to install all dependencies and then run bot:</b>
<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

### Don't forget to sign up here https://my.telegram.org/auth, and replace api_id, api_hash and phone number in code

<b>Only chat owner is able to use commands:</b>
<pre> /checkout <b> to clean up chat from inactive users who were not online more than 4 days</b></pre>

### I've added to bot simple anti-spam strategy, such as responding on keywords

### The user who will use those words will be banned in chat ['spam', 'discount', 'sell']

### After every process there will be a status message in chat
